1-In the index.html file, we mainly implement the basic framework of the bubble chart of this experiment. In the script.js file, we specifically implement the functions of the bubble chart, including: Combine, Continent, ContryCenters, Population four kinds of data display, Colors and Flags between the bubble data display toggle key, and through the implementation of picking certain bubbles function, and then achieve the bar chart Display Population, so that you can easily compare the population of different countries. In addition, a search box was added as well as a country column to allow readers to look up information about a particular country. Finally we also added a fisheye function via fisheye.js which helps in displaying small data points.

2-Presentation of other documents:The flags.zip stores the flag images of each country, the continent-names.json stores the abbreviated names of each state, the countries.csv file stores the name of the state in which each country is located, the total population, and other information, and the styles.css file stores the position, colour, and other information in the visualisation components.

3-Restricted by D3's own frame: when there is a sudden movement of the image and some overlapping phenomenon, please hold down the Ctrl key and control the mouse wheel to adjust the display effect or click on the F11 button to make the display page full-screen; when there is a confusion of bubbles in the Combine, please click on the page for refreshing.

4- We have referred to this URL:https://github.com/jeffreymorganio/d3-country-bubble-chart for further improvements based on Jeffrey Morgan.

Here are some demonstration of our project which is optimized by our team based on Jeffrey Morgan's design.
