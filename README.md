In the index.html file, we mainly implement the basic framework of the bubble chart for this experiment.In the script.js file, we specifically implement the functions of the bubble chart, including: Combine, Continent, ContryCenters, Population four kinds of data display, Colors and Flags between the bubble data display switch key, and through the implementation of the selection of certain bubbles function, and then the implementation of the bar chart Display the population number, which is convenient for you to compare the population number of different countries. In addition, we have added a search box and a country column to allow readers to look up information about a particular country. Finally I also added a fisheye function via fisheye.js which helps in displaying small data points.
